# Craft to Exile 2 Planner

With the **Craft to Exile 2 Planner** you can plan your builds and share them with others.

> The tool can be found here: https://cofeiini.github.io/cte2-planner

## Quick Start

To get started, all you need to do is visit the tool's page and allocate points just like in the game.  
After you are done, you can copy the current link from your browser's URL bar and share it with others. When someone clicks the link, the tool will recreate
your point allocations.  
There are also export and import options, if you want a more convenient way to archive your builds.

## Reporting Errors and Suggesting Enhancements

You can use the [Issues Page](https://github.com/Cofeiini/cte2-planner/issues) to report any errors (for example, mismatches in the tree or bugs in the tool)
and to suggest new features.
